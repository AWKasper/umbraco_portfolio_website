## Umbraco Portfolio website

This is a portfolio website that was made during the Umbraco Professional course and with some individual work put in after completing the course. 
It has a blog, a page with my projects, some general info and a page where you can search for anything on the page.
The styling needs lots of work as that was a last priority during the course.

## Project status
I am still working on this project and intend to use it as my actual portfolio website in the future.
